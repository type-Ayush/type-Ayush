# About Me

My name is <b>Ayush Jain</b>. I am currently pursuing a <i>Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering</i> at <i><b>Lovely Professional University</b></i>. I am from Indore, and I have always been fascinated by the field of technology and innovation. Even though I am a novice in coding, I opted for engineering because I really like creating projects and cracking tough problems. <br><br>
My interests lie in both software development and physical systems, especially in fields that are electrical engineering and aerospace-related. I'm excited to learn how computational thinking can be used to solve real-world problems, and I'm looking forward to developing my skills through practical experience and ongoing learning.

## Background & Spark

I was born in Indore in 2006 and grew up between Indore and Gwalior. I completed my pre-primary education in Gwalior, then returned to Indore for the rest of my primary years. Currently, I'm an undergraduate at Lovely Professional University, immersing myself in the world of software and electronics.<br><br>
In the past, I was actually very interested in chemistry—intrigued by reactions, lab work, and the magic of how things worked. But in middle school, I saw people working on Arduino projects and electronics. I attempted to join in, but the group I was in didn't really foster creativity or teamwork, and the teachers weren't much help either. That experience left me thinking the whole field was overrated, so I moved on.<br><br>
Things changed when I switched schools in my secondary phase. One of my teachers introduced us to the L293D motor driver IC, and something just clicked. I began imagining all sorts of ideas around it, and for the first time, I was actually excited. A few classmates got interested too, and we formed a small group. I'd describe the IC and my ideas in class, and the appreciation I received—from my teacher and even the class clapping—really gave me a boost. That moment sparked something in me, and I began spending most of my time learning about electronics and software.<br><br>
Of course, that came at a price—my grades in Grade 10 suffered because I was so busy building and learning outside the syllabus. I even had this crazy idea of building a fully controllable system using only transistors, no microcontrollers. But I didn't know enough at the time, and with JEE prep taking over in senior secondary, I had to shelve that dream. It's still on my bucket list, though.<br><br>
Chemistry still has a special place in my heart, but after senior secondary, I realized it's not all about cool reactions—it's a lot more abstract and theoretical. I still like it, just not with the same passion as before.<br><br>
Now, I'm focusing my energy on creating systems that combine creativity with technical substance. I want to create things that are alive—responsive, dynamic, and perhaps even a little bit magical.

## Hobbies

- **Chess** - I enjoy playing chess as my preferred indoor game. It offers a unique blend of mental stimulation and strategic depth, where calculating sacrifices for long-term advantage is both challenging and rewarding. The game provides a fascinating balance of stress and enjoyment, making each match intellectually engaging. I particularly favor the Rapid format, as it strikes an ideal balance—neither too lengthy nor too brief. As of September 2025, my rating is approximately 900.

- **Badminton** - Badminton is the one outdoor game I really connect with. It’s got this great mix of movement and ease—sometimes you’re sprinting across the court, and other times you’re just casually rallying and chatting with the person across from you. That’s what makes it fun: it doesn’t demand intense focus like some other sports, so you can enjoy the game and the company at the same time. It’s especially nice for couples or friends just looking to have a good time. Plus, it’s super easy to pick up, even if you’ve never played before.

- **Electronics** - I’ve always had a strong passion for electronics and the instruments that come with it. There’s something deeply satisfying about working hands-on—whether it’s experimenting with circuits, solving unexpected problems, or coming up with new ideas from scratch. It’s not just about the process; it’s the feeling of reward when everything finally clicks and the outcome reflects the effort. That sense of accomplishment keeps me coming back, again and again.<br><br>Even though I’m still learning the ropes in electronics, that’s never stopped me from dreaming up ideas. I know I don’t have all the answers yet, but I believe in the process—step by step, I’ll figure it out. Every project I imagine, every concept I sketch out, is something I’m determined to bring to life one day. It’s not just about what I know now, it’s about where I’m headed. And I’m not afraid to chase it.

- **Programming** - Just like electronics, programming has become a core part of how I think and create. I love writing code that brings hardware to life—whether it’s controlling a circuit, automating a process, or building something entirely new. There’s a special kind of satisfaction in seeing a program I wrote interact seamlessly with the physical world. I enjoy experimenting, testing, and refining my code—not just to make things work, but to understand how and why they work. It’s not just about building projects; it’s about exploring ideas, solving problems, and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.<br><br>Even though I’m still learning programming, that doesn’t hold me back from diving into new ideas. I love writing code that supports my electronics projects and brings them to life—whether it’s controlling hardware, automating tasks, or building something experimental just to see what’s possible. Every time I test a new program, it’s like opening a door to a new possibility. I know I’m still growing, but I’m confident that the things I imagine today will become real one day. It’s all part of the journey, and I’m here for it.

- **Story Writting** - I love creating stories and expressing them through words. Most of the time, my main characters are female—I’m not exactly sure why, but it just feels right when I’m building their worlds and personalities. The scenes I imagine don’t just stay on paper—they become part of my life. Whenever I listen to music in my free time, my mind drifts into those stories. I think about the characters, their journeys, and how to shape their powers and emotions to match the mood of the music. It’s like the songs fuel my imagination, helping me expand the story and explore new ideas.<br><br>
I know my English isn’t perfect yet, but that doesn’t stop me from writing. I use the language I know to bring my stories to life, and I’m learning more every day. One day, when I’ve mastered it, I’ll rewrite everything with the depth and clarity I dream of—and I’ll publish it. That’s a promise I’ve made to myself.

- **Beat Mixing** - I enjoy creating beats in the genres of Hip-Hop, Synthwave, and Phonk, where rhythm is fused with emotion. Music, to me, isn't noise—it's narrative. I tend to construct tracks based on the characters in my tales, defining their moods, abilities, and paths through basslines and melodies. Whether it's an eerie synth for an enigmatic protagonist or a raw drum loop for a renegade arc, every beat is incorporated into their universe. Music assists me in diving deeper into their feelings and taking the story beyond words.<br><br>Though I'm still learning, I know that once I master it, I'll create something truly great.



## Personality
I believe in staying polite, no matter the situation or the kind of person I’m dealing with. Everyone deserves respect, and that includes honoring their boundaries. In serious moments, I try not to let emotions cloud my judgment—unless it’s about someone close to me. Even then, I make sure my actions don’t harm anyone. I prefer to understand the situation fully before reacting, rather than acting out of frustration or impulse.

I think everything exists for a reason, but that doesn’t mean we should blindly believe in it. Understanding should always come before acceptance. Every person has a unique life, and they should be free to live it their own way—as long as it respects the rules and doesn’t disturb others. Everyone deserves love, and no one should be criticized for being different. No matter what, I believe we should all remain polite.
